The projects goal was to create a webb application that handle customer information.

The file manifest consists of a file for both HTML, CSS and Javascript in general public file, and also a .gitignore file.

Struggles consisted mostly of output issues in UI, it was solved with JSON.stringify to translate object value to string value.

Credit to MDN as main source of information, used to understand how to change a object to string.

Known current "bugs" are output in UI, as the customer information includes characters from the code, which got implemented into the string values as it was transformed from object
